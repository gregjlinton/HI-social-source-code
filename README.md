HI-social-source-code
=====================

After an interesting SMS test debate with my friend, I figure this needed to be built. 
A source code for Human Interactions. 
The sorts of things that many engineers, software developers, scientists and other geeks fail at. 
Interaction between humans in a social setting.

The SMS conversation started like this:
Greg:" Have you worked with an Arduino microcontroller yet?
Friend (who has a master's in computer science): "No. Looks like fun but I've have had no time"
Greg:"Ah. I put aside time last night to do some coding. I may be getting the hang of some of the basics. Took me way to long though."
Friend: As long as you get it. Doesn't matter how long. I am still trying to basics of social intereaction and I've been trying on and off for 37 years."
Greg:" Yeah. There's no standards document for that though. Would be a really fun GitHub project. HI social source code.
Friend:" This is true"

Tah Dah!

So why the heck not make it happen. Come up with use cases and go for it.
